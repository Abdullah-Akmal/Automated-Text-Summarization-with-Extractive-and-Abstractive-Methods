# Text Summarization

## Description  
This notebook demonstrates text summarization techniques using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers both extractive and abstractive summarization methods to generate concise summaries from long-form text. Techniques include TF-IDF, TextRank, and transformer-based models like BART or T5.  
**[Dataset Source â€“ News articles or custom text inputs]**

## Objectives  
- Implement both extractive and abstractive text summarization  
- Preprocess and clean large text data  
- Apply classical NLP and deep learning methods for summarization  
- Evaluate summary quality using NLP metrics  

## Methodology / Steps  
- Import and clean raw text data  
- Tokenize, remove stopwords, and apply stemming or lemmatization  
- Generate extractive summaries using frequency-based and graph-based methods (TextRank)  
- Generate abstractive summaries using transformer models (e.g., BART, T5)  
- Compare summaries and evaluate using ROUGE or BLEU scores  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
Python, NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, gensim, Hugging Face Transformers (BART, T5), ROUGE, pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
